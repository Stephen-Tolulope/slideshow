        <!-- <p>What sets the lion apart, how come it's regarded as the king of the forest?

            You can think of numerous reasons, some that like excuses will attribute it to some special characteristics as they try to point out their own inadequacies; but so you know, the lion is not the fastest, nor strongest, not even wisest or most beautiful animal there is...
            
            You can think of a number of things but I'll tell you this, this beast knows itself and maximises its potential; that counts for a lot, so look inward friend.
